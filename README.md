# The amazing Remember This App 🤩

📚 First mandatory assignment in Full Stack Node.js course at EK, formerly known as KEA aka Erhvervsakademi København (datamatiker / ap in computer science).

🎯 Objective: to make a fullstack web application with CRUD functionality and server side rendering (more like a hybrid with a little client side rendering), where the user can read up on the different topics covered in the lectures half way through the course.

/Enjoy 🤓
